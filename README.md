# LSTM-stock-price

# Ironhack final project

## Team:
Vladislav Lis<br>
Markus Schmidt

## Plan:
* preparation: learning about neural networks (RNN, LSTM models) (week 1)
* test runs: using LSTM on various data sets (yahoo finance API) (week 1)
* tweaking hyperparameters (week1)
* making a final model (week 2)
* presenation preparation (week 2)
* optional: interface (week 2)

## Goal:
* creating an LSTM model predicting price for any stock / currency / commodity based on its closing price
